# Machine-learning-algos
This is where I keep implementation of different machine learning algorithms while still being in a learning phase.

This repo also contains, my practices done on matplolib & pandas & machine learning.

MNIST_Sequential_NN is handwritten digits classifier built using tensorflow and keras.

This might be useful.
